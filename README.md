# 💡 Leetcode Practice From Beginning (Java) 💡

## 📚 What is this repository for?
This is a repository of my experience practicing Leetcode from scratch. I'm preparing to apply for 2023/2024 SDE internship/NG application. Have 6 months Bootcamp experience and starting undergrad CS in June 2022. My ultimate goal is to get a winter 2023 or spring 2024 internship or 2023 full time SDE position.

## 📝 Current Process

Plan to brush up on questions from data structures to algorithms, figure out the characteristics of each type, summarize my own templates, and brush up on classic high-frequency Easy and Medium questions before any interview.
